<h1>OSMTimeLapseR</h1>

<p>Welcome to OSMTimeLapseR. This package helps you visualize the edits to OSM in a certain part of the world. It was developed based on a request from the OSM Nepal community, whose work growing OSM in Kathmandu can be seen below: </p>

<p>A monthly visualization is <a href="demo/kathmandu_monthly.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: We are NOT visualizing all changes to OSM. We are only visualizing the last changed date of all nodes that still exist in OSM. This under-reports changes, and is slightly biased towards later dates. In Kathmandu's case, 90% of the nodes were only edited once, and the last edit represents 80% of all edits, so this approximation was found to be appropriate. You may want to test your own assumptions.</p>

<h2>Create your own</h2>

<ul>
<li>To see how the above visualizations were produced, see the corresponding demos: <a href="demo/AnimateGIF.html">GIF</a>, <a href="demo/AnimateHTML.html">HTML</a>.</li>
<li>To work with your own datasets, see <a href="demo/AnimateFromFile.html">this demo</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation instructions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Install R (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">Mac</a>, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">Windows</a>, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/">Other</a>). I also recommend installing <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/">RStudio</a>.</li>
<li>Install OSMTimeLapseR by typing the following in your R console:
<ul>
<li><code>install.packages('devtools'); require(devtools); install_github("prabhasp/OSMTimeLapseR")</code> </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Install Java (required by R's <code>OpenStreetMap</code> package).</li>
<li>If you want to work with your own files, install <a href="osmconvert">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert</a></li>
